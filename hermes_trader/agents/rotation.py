"""Capital rotation — the Phase-1 fix for the #1 cause of missed moves.

Phase-1 audit finding: 94% of missed big movers die at the 300% notional cap or
max_concurrent — i.e. the book is FULL, not the signal absent. Capital is
allocated first-come-first-served with no ranking, so a strong fresh signal can
never displace a weak, stale position. This module decides when it should.

PURE FUNCTION — no network, no side effects, fully testable. The caller (executor,
in SHADOW mode first) logs the decision; only when shadow_mode is off does it act.

Principle blend of the greats:
  - ride winners (Seykota/Livermore): NEVER evict a position that's still working
    (roe >= protect_winner_roe_pct) — let the trend run.
  - cut what isn't working (Dennis/Turtles): the eviction target is the WEAKEST
    non-winner (lowest ROE), and only after it's had min_hold_minutes to prove out.
  - opportunity cost (Druckenmiller: concentrate capital in the best ideas): only a
    genuinely strong fresh signal (composite >= min_candidate_composite) justifies
    paying the round-trip fees to rotate.
