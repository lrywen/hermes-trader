"""Cross-process positions snapshot.

The trading loop fetches the full account state (`fetch_account_state`,
~9 HTTP POSTs across the main + HIP-3 clearinghouses) every cycle. The web
dashboard used to fetch the SAME state independently on every poll — two
processes sharing one IP, neither's rate-limiter aware of the other, which
collectively tripped Hyperliquid's per-IP weight limit (429s + read timeouts).

The loop already paid for that fetch, so it now writes the raw position list
to a small snapshot file each cycle. The dashboard reads the snapshot instead
of calling HL, making it a pure file reader for the positions view. Only the
loop talks to HL → the cross-process contention is gone. The snapshot is at
most one loop-cycle stale (~60s), which is invisible for a bot that holds
positions for hours.
