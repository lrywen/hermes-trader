# Deploy hermes-trader to Fly.io

Single-machine Fly deployment running the dashboard (public) + trading loop (private)
out of one image, sharing one persistent volume for `.dsl-state.json`,
`.agent-memory.json`, `.agent-config.json`, and the session log.

Cost: roughly **$2–4/month** for two `shared-cpu-1x` VMs + 1GB volume.

## One-time setup

```bash
# 1. Install Fly CLI (Mac)
brew install flyctl
flyctl auth signup   # or `flyctl auth login` if you already have an account

# 2. From the repo root, launch the app (skips automatic deploy so we can wire secrets first)
flyctl launch --no-deploy --copy-config

# When prompted:
#   - App name: pick something unique (e.g. hermes-trader-julian)
#   - Region: pick one near you (iad / ord / fra / nrt …)
#   - Postgres / Redis: NO
#   - Deploy now: NO

# 3. Create the persistent volume (one per region; size = 1GB is plenty)
flyctl volumes create hermes_data --size 1 --region iad

# 4. Wire secrets — never put these in fly.toml or the image
flyctl secrets set \
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-..." \
  HYPERLIQUID_WALLET_ADDRESS="0x..." \
  HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..." \
  HERMES_OPERATOR_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 16)"

# Optional secrets
flyctl secrets set BRAVE_API_KEY="BSA..."                    # news in research
flyctl secrets set HYPERLIQUID_MASTER_ADDRESS="0x..."        # agent-wallet setup

# 5. First deploy
flyctl deploy
```

After a successful deploy you'll get a URL like `https://hermes-trader-julian.fly.dev`.
The dashboard and operator console are now Vue SPA pages served at `/web/`
(`/` redirects there). The operator console is at `/web/operator`; unlock it
in-page with the `HERMES_OPERATOR_TOKEN` (sent via the `X-Operator-Token`
header, never in the URL).

> **Note:** this repo's Dockerfile does not build or `COPY` the SPA — the
> `hermes-web/dist` bundle lives in the separate `hermes-web` repo. A bare
> Fly image therefore serves only the JSON API (`/api/*`, `/metrics`); to
> get the UI on Fly, add a build step that bakes `hermes-web/dist` into
> `/app/web-dist`. The docker-compose deployment gets the SPA automatically
> via bind-mount.

## Reading + rotating secrets

```bash
flyctl secrets list                                # names only, never values
flyctl secrets set HERMES_OPERATOR_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 16)"   # rotate
flyctl secrets unset BRAVE_API_KEY                 # remove
```

Setting or unsetting a secret triggers a rolling redeploy.

## Tailing logs

```bash
flyctl logs                          # combined web + loop
flyctl logs -i web                   # dashboard server only
flyctl logs -i loop                  # trading loop only
```

## Pausing the bot without redeploying

```bash
flyctl machines stop --process-group loop                # halt trading loop
flyctl machines start --process-group loop               # resume
```

The web process keeps serving the dashboard either way — operators can read state
without the loop running, useful for incident response.

You can also flip the mode in the operator console (set mode `OFF`) — the loop
stays alive but stops opening new positions; existing positions still get DSL-managed.

## Deploying new code

```bash
git push          # main branch; doesn't trigger deploy
flyctl deploy     # builds image + rolls both processes
```

For zero-downtime deploys, Fly does the web rolling restart for free. The loop
process briefly drops; the next scan tick (~60s later) resumes.

## SSH into the running machine

```bash
flyctl ssh console -s
ls /data                              # see the persisted state files
tail -f /data/session-log.jsonl       # live activity from inside the box
```

## Backing up volume state

```bash
flyctl ssh sftp shell
get /data/.dsl-state.json
get /data/.agent-memory.json
get /data/session-log.jsonl
```

Or set up a periodic snapshot:

```bash
flyctl volumes snapshots create hermes_data
flyctl volumes snapshots list hermes_data
```

## Switching to a custom domain

```bash
flyctl certs add hermes.yourdomain.com
flyctl certs show hermes.yourdomain.com    # follow the DNS-CNAME instructions
```

## Common gotchas

- **Both processes need the volume mount.** The trading loop writes
  `.dsl-state.json`, the web process reads it. Both `processes = ["web", "loop"]`
  is intentional in `[[mounts]]`.
- **Mode defaults to OFF.** First boot writes `/data/.agent-config.json` with
  `mode: "OFF"`. Open the operator console and flip to `LIVE` once you've
  verified the dashboard.
- **Time on Fly is UTC.** The dashboard converts to your browser's local zone;
  the session log timestamps are epoch ms (timezone-agnostic).
- **The `~/.hermes-trader.pid` file** that the FastAPI start/stop endpoints
  reference is meaningless in a container — Fly handles process supervision.
  Those endpoints will report stopped state inside Fly; ignore them and use
  `flyctl machines stop --process-group loop` instead.
