"""Whale Index — smart-money signal heuristics over the Hyperliquid universe.

Provides OI/funding-based concentration and accumulation signals. The HL
PUBLIC api has NO leaderboard endpoint (verified: vaults/leaderBoard/
vaultDetails all return None), so production uses self-sourced, verifiable
signals (OI surge + negative funding) rather than a static wallet registry.
The older per-wallet leaderboard/get_trader_state helpers were removed
because the WHALE_WALLETS registry was always empty — they only ever
returned [] / None and gave a false impression of coverage. MCP callers use
hyperfeed.leaderboard_get_top (private backend) instead.
